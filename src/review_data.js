		summary: "The hallal food at the 'Hallal Gals' is the best this city has to offer! The food is amazing. The hot sauce doesn't burn your face off and you could feed a family of 3 on just one of their platters. The lines might be long, but the food is worth the wait.",

		headline: "Over-priced and mediocre",
		summary: "Nathan's is a New York institution, but having tried the hot dogs myself I have to say this... WAY over-priced. My meal costs over $10 and all I had was a hot dog, fries, and a soda. Food was OK, but not for the price. Yes, you can say you ate at Nathan's, but it'll cost you.",
